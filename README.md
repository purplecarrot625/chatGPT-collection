## Introduction

This report is for personal study purposes and is directed towards ChatGPT.

As a Computer Science graduate student at Oregon State University, I am both fascinated and apprehensive about the increasing prevalence of ChatGPT technology. On one hand, I am excited about the potential of ChatGPT as an efficient learning tool for not just technical knowledge, but also for improving my English writing skills. (*As an international student, I understand the importance of clear and effective communication when working with team members.*)

On the other hand, as a software development engineer, I am concerned about the possibility of chatbots eventually replacing our jobs. Instead of fearing the technology, I am taking a proactive approach and seeking to establish ChatGPT as a valuable partner in my professional growth, rather than viewing it as a threat to my career.
